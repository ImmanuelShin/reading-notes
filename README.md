# Growth Mindset
## What is it?
Every person sees the world in different lenses. These lenses will influence how a person reacts to different stimuli. Growth mindset is one of these lenses. 
`Growth mindset`, as a lense, guides the person towards `acceptance` and `adaptability` when faced with problems. Whether these problems are challenges, obstacles, or criticisms, growth mindset will allow the person to take them all in stride and `continue moving forward`.
### Reminders for myself:
1. Don't get distracted:
   - Instead of "briefly" taking a break when faced with an obstacle that I am too lazy to work on, just do it. Think of the future and how much better it will feel to be already done with the obstacle that I am avoiding.
2. Divide effort:
   - It is easy to lack the motivation to start on things, such as large obstacles, but think of the freeing sensation I will get when I finish all of my tasks.
3. Focus on myself:
   - Stop looking at how fast other people are going. It doesn't make sense to look at them when they are racing in an entirely different event.
