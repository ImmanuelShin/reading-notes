## Tackling The Whiteboard Interview

Whiteboard-style interviews are common in the tech industry, where candidates solve technical questions on a whiteboard, paper, or computer. Despite their challenges, effective communication can significantly improve your performance.

### **The Best Advice: Communicate!**
The most crucial advice for whiteboard interviews is to communicate effectively throughout the process. This involves several key steps.

### **1. Restate the Question:**
- **Objective:** Ensure clarity on the problem.
- **Example (Using Fizz-Buzz):**
  - Restate the problem to the interviewer.
  - Seek affirmation to confirm understanding.
  - Clarify any potential misunderstandings early on.

### **2. Ask About Edge Cases:**
- **Objective:** Identify and address potential edge cases.
- **Example (Continuing with Fizz-Buzz):**
  - Inquire about possible edge cases.
  - Show analytical thinking and consideration for different scenarios.

### **3. Ask About Test Cases:**
- **Objective:** Gather information on expected test cases.
- **Example:**
  - Inquire about specific test cases the function should pass.
  - Demonstrate awareness of the importance of testing.

### **4. Write Pseudocode and Validate:**
- **Objective:** Develop a logical plan before diving into code.
- **Example (Continuing with Fizz-Buzz):**
  - Write pseudocode first to outline the logic.
  - Ask the interviewer if the pseudocode makes sense.
  - Discuss and validate your approach before proceeding.

### **5. Write the Actual Code:**
- **Objective:** Convert pseudocode into actual code.
- **Example (Continuing with Fizz-Buzz):**
  - Translate the pseudocode into the chosen programming language.
  - Don't hesitate to ask for syntax or method names if needed.
  - Keep comments to explain the code's logic.

### **6. Ask if the Solution Looks Good:**
- **Objective:** Seek validation for your final solution.
- **Example:**
  - Ask the interviewer if the implemented solution meets expectations.
  - Be open to feedback and discussion on potential improvements.

### **7. Stuck? Ask for Help:**
- **Objective:** Don't hesitate to seek guidance if needed.
- **Example:**
  - Politely express if you're facing challenges.
  - Request tips or nudges to move in the right direction.
  - Emphasize a collaborative problem-solving approach.

### **Bonus: Communicate Prior to the Interview:**
- **Objective:** Gather essential information before the interview.
- **Example Questions for HR or Interview Point of Contact:**
  - Is there a coding portion in the interview?
  - Can you provide details on the interview format?
  - Any specifics on preparation (language, style, etc.)?

## Whiteboarding Tips

### **1) Take a Few Minutes:**
Interviewees often rush into problem-solving while talking, making it challenging to concentrate. After the problem is explained, take a moment to think. Politely inform the interviewer that you'll spend a minute or two contemplating the problem. This allows for focused thought and a more articulate response.

### **2) Write Down the Steps of the Solution:**
Before coding, outline the solution steps on one side of the whiteboard. Clearly express the logical flow without delving into code details. This visual representation aids clarity and organization.

### **3) Write Pseudocode First:**
Instead of immediately writing code, create pseudocode to outline the solution's structure. This "dry run" helps ensure logical coherence before dealing with syntax. Many interviewers consider well-constructed pseudocode a valid solution.

### **4) Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff:**
Programming interviews assess problem-solving and overall knowledge, not memorization of minor details. If you forget something, acknowledge it, and express a willingness to look it up. Focus on demonstrating problem-solving abilities and a clear understanding of the problem.

### **5) Sit Down. Be Humble:**
Programming interviews evaluate more than coding skills; they assess communication, collaboration, and how well you handle feedback. Accept criticism graciously, maintain respect, and exhibit qualities like empathy and honesty.

### **6) Come Prepared:**
Invest significant time in preparation. The book "Cracking the Coding Interview" is recommended, reflecting the importance of sustained preparation (HOBIS – Hours of Butt-In-Seat) for success and peace of mind during and after the interview.

### **7) Review Your Work:**
Use any extra time to review your solution, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and correctness. Consider edge cases, algorithm optimizations, and demonstrate your commitment to producing accurate and high-quality code.

## Deconstructed Interview

### Purpose of Interview

The primary goal of an interview is to predict who would be a good employee, and a good interview is one that is predictive.

### Realism vs. Predictiveness

While realistic interviews are beneficial, the focus should be on predictiveness. Even if an interview is not realistic but remains predictive, it can still be considered effective.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

Using data structures and algorithms in interviews is justified as it helps assess a candidate's problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to simplify problems.

### Intelligence Across Seniority Levels

Intelligence is considered important across various job levels, and even for senior roles, problem-solving and intelligence remain crucial.

### Company Expectations

Companies should adjust their expectations based on the role and focus on assessing a candidate's problem-solving skills, intelligence, and ability to analyze problems relevant to the job.

### Interviewer Training

Companies should provide interviewer training to ensure a structured and consistent hiring process. Transparency with candidates and interviewers is crucial for an effective process.

### Companies Doing Well

Facebook is mentioned as a company that does reasonably well in the interview process. The emphasis is on structured hiring, consistency, interview training, and transparency.

### Interview Preparation

Candidates are advised to spend a couple of weeks preparing for interviews, focusing on mastering basic data structures and algorithms. Confidence in problem-solving skills is essential.

### Usefulness of Interview Preparation

Interview preparation is seen as valuable, especially in boosting a candidate's confidence and helping them approach challenging problems with a problem-solving mindset.

### No Perfect Process

The interview process is acknowledged as imperfect, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Companies should be aware of biases and flaws in their processes.

### Assessment of Intelligence

Problem-solving questions in interviews are seen as effective in assessing a candidate's intelligence. The emphasis is on understanding the candidate's thought process and problem-solving approach.

### Handling False Positives and Negatives

It's acceptable to have some false negatives in hiring to limit false positives. The goal is to hire enough good candidates while minimizing the risk of hiring those who might not perform well.

### Candidates without CS Degrees

Individuals without computer science degrees, including boot camp graduates or self-taught developers, can succeed in interviews with the right preparation. Insecurity is often a hurdle that needs to be overcome.

### Bias and Calibration

Interviewers should avoid being influenced by a candidate's confidence level. Calibration across interviewers is not necessary; each interviewer should self-calibrate. Calibration can be achieved through practices like bar razors.

### Decision-Making Framework

Decision-making is not about achieving consensus but assessing attributes like problem-solving skills, intelligence, and the ability to work well with others. Each interviewer's evaluation is considered independently.

### Interview Committee vs. Bar Razors

Both interview committees and bar razors are seen as effective models for decision-making, with bar razors gaining popularity due to their advantages in calibration.

### Continuous Improvement

Companies should continuously improve their interview processes, adapt to biases and flaws, and focus on assessing candidates based on relevant job attributes.

### The First Shipped Code

The interviewee shared a personal anecdote about the first code they shipped, which involved a feature for switching accounts in the I chat team at Apple during their internship.
