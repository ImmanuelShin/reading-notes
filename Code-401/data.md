# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Choosing the Right Data Structure

One of the crucial factors when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency of operations. You should consider the type and frequency of operations (insertion, deletion, retrieval) required by the problem. For example, if fast retrieval is a priority, a hash table might be suitable, while if maintaining order is essential, a linked list or a balanced tree could be more appropriate.

## Avoiding Infinite Recursion

To ensure we avoid an infinite recursive call stack, it's important to have a proper base case in recursive functions. The base case defines a condition under which the recursion stops. Without a well-defined base case, the function would keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow. Additionally, it's essential to design the recursive algorithm in a way that converges toward the base case with each recursive call, ensuring progress toward termination.
