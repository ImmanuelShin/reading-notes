# Engineering Readings

## Thinking Like a Programmer

Programmers will face multiple challenges that will always need tackling. In order to maintain sanity, it's important to keep a few ideas in mind:

- Understand: Know exactly what is being asked.
- Plan: Don't dive right into solving without planning.
- Divide: Break large problems into small sub-problems.
- Stuck?: Take a deep breath and then debug, reassess, and maybe start anew.
- Practice: Practice makes perfect.

## Solving problems

- Read the problem completely twice: Understand the problem thoroughly by reading it multiple times. Make sure you can explain it to someone else, and work through any provided examples.

- Solve the problem manually: Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually. Solve the problem manually with at least three sets of sample data, identifying each step and understanding the logic behind it.

- Optimize the manual solution: Before moving to code, try to optimize or simplify the manual solution. Recognize patterns or repetitive steps that can be streamlined.

- Write pseudo-code or comments: Capture the steps in comments or pseudo-code. Clearly outline the structure of the code you're going to write, making it easier to translate into actual code.

- Replace comments with real code: Convert each comment or pseudo-code line into actual code. This step should be straightforward if you've followed the previous ones diligently.

- Optimize the real code: Review the real code for any possible optimizations or simplifications. Ensure meaningful variable names and eliminate redundancy.

## 5 Whys

- Why is the problem occurring?
  - The initial question to understand the immediate cause of the problem.
- Why is that the case?
  - Dig deeper to identify the factors or events that contribute to the observed issue.
- Why did that happen?
  - Continue the inquiry to explore the underlying reasons behind the factors identified in the second question.
- Why did that occur?
  - Further investigate the root causes by probing into the factors mentioned in the third question.
- Why did that take place?
  - The final question aims to reach the fundamental or systemic cause that, when addressed, can prevent the recurrence of the problem.

## What about me

What distinguishes me is the unique blend of adaptability and proactive problem-solving that I bring to the table. Whether swiftly learning a new map library for a project or tailoring tutoring methods for different age groups, my ability to adapt seamlessly to diverse challenges is evident. I don't just face challenges; I tackle them head-on, as seen in experiences creating a proof of concept for an unfamiliar map library or leading a group through unexpected hurdles. This combination of adaptability and proactive problem-solving allows me to integrate into different environments, take on new responsibilities, and contribute to innovative solutions, enhancing the effectiveness and success of the team or project.

## How to Unstuck

1. Take a step back and view it from a large perspective.
2. Debug like crazy.
3. cry
