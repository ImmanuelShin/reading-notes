# Growth Mindset

## Deliberate Practice

Deliberate practice is a focused, purposeful method of skill improvement that involves engaging in activities specifically designed to enhance specific aspects of an individual's performance. It requires stepping slightly outside one's comfort zone and involves tasks that are both challenging and repetitive, ensuring continuous learning and adaptation. This approach is characterized by constant feedback, which is crucial for identifying areas of improvement and tracking progress. Deliberate practice is mentally demanding and requires well-defined goals, making it distinct from routine or passive practice. It's widely recognized for its effectiveness in fields ranging from music to sports, and in professional and academic learning.

## Emotional Intelligence

My scores in emotional intelligence were consistently around 22, with the exception of Relationship Management, which stood at 17. I find these scores to be quite reflective of my abilities. While I excel in understanding myself and my surroundings, my challenge lies in summoning the energy to engage with the environment, stemming from occasional reluctance to interact with others. Despite this, I can still navigate social interactions when necessary, albeit at a quicker energy depletion rate compared to others. Recognizing this, I am committed to ongoing efforts in improving this aspect of my emotional intelligence in the future.

## Bias

My total score was 102 out of 120 in the assessment of biases. I excelled in areas such as 'Bias and the Brain', 'Empathy and Curiosity', 'Meaningful Connections', and 'Effective Courage', while my weaker areas were 'Bias and Identity', 'Connect to Mitigate Bias', and 'Four Ways to Act'. My perspective on bias is that it's a constant presence, both within myself and potentially in others. I recognize that biases can range from being harmful to trivial, and sometimes even advantageous. I believe in the importance of continually learning about and understanding biases. However, I also acknowledge that the strategies for addressing biases should vary depending on the specific context and situation.
