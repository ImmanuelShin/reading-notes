# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow

The order in which a computer executes statements in a script.

Code runs in order from the first line to the last line, except in the frequent cases in which structures change the control flow (conditionals, loops).

## Functions

A block of code designed too perform a particular task. It is executed when invoked (called).

In JavaScript, a function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function and parentheses (). Any potential parameters go inside the parentheses.
> function function_name(parameter1, parameter2) {  
> super complicated code.  
> }

### Invocation

In order to execute a function, it must first be invoked (called).

There are few ways to call a function:

- When an event occurs (button clicks).
- When it is specifically invoked from JavaScript code.
- When it is self invoked.

Make sure to include the parentheses () when calling a function, otherwise, the function will return itself instead of the function result.

## Operators

There are multiple operators used in JavaScript:

- Assignment Operator: Assigns a value to a variable.
  - > let x = 10;
- Addition Operator: Adds numbers.
  - > let x = 3 + 7;
- Multiplication Operator: Multiplies numbers.
  - > let x = 2 * 5;
- [And many, many, more.](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp)
