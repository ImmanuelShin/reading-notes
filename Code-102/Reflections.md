# Reflections

## Class 1

Had to think about my strengths and weaknesses. Introspective thoughts are always in the back of my mind, but it is a bit different to really bring those thoughts out into words.

## Class 2

Introduced to developer tools: Text editors, terminals, hackerman stuff.

Ubuntu, node.js, VS Code, npm, tree, etc.

I still don't know exactly what I downloaded, and I don't think I could do it again without step by step instruction. But at least everything is working now.

## Class 3

Learned how to use git and terminals.

Changing the structure of the website makes me realize how important organization and planning are when it comes to a smooth coding experience. Also, the amount of changes and edits I created really shows how important constant communication is.
