# Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that allows you to format plain text.

## Why use Markdown?

Markdown is useful as a universal, portable, and simple language that can be used everywhere and on anything.

## Markdown Formatting: 

### Headings

To create headings in Markdown, you use a number sign (#) in front of the heading. The tier of heading is distinguished by the number of #'s, with one # being the highest level heading and six #'s being the lowest.

> # # Heading 1
>
> ###### ###### Heading 6

### **Bold** and *Italics*

Enboldening text requires either two asterisks or underscores before an after the word or phrase. Italicization requires simply one asterisk or underscore before and after.

> **\*\*Bold\*\*** or __\_\_Bold\_\___
>
> *\*Italic\** or _\_Italic\__

To both Bold and Italicize at the same time, use either three asterisks or three underscores before and after the word or phrase.

> ***\*\*\*Bold and Italic\*\*\**** or ___\_\_\_Bold and Italic\_\_\____

Keep in mind that the best practice for enboldening or italicizing the middle of a word is to use asterisks rather than underscores

> En\*\*bold\*\*en = En**bold**en
>
> I\*talic\*ize = I*talic*ize
>
> En\*\*\*bolic\*\*\*ize = En***bolic***ize

### Links

To create a link,  you can either:

1. Simply enclose the URL within angle brackets.
   > <<https://www.google.com/>>
2. Format your link into a title using brackets and parentheses
   > [[Google]](https://www.google.com)(https://www.google.com) is the leading search engine.
   - You can also include a tooltip that appears when you hover over the title:
     > [[Google]](https://www.google.com "The leading search engine")(https://www.google.com "The leading search engine").

### Bullet Lists

In order to create an unordered list, you may either use:

1. A dash (-)

   > - \- First symbol

2. An asterisk (*)

   > - \* Second symbol

3. A plus sign (+)

   > - \+ Third symbol

You can nest multiple bullets within one another:

> - - - - - hello
