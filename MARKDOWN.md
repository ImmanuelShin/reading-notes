# Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that allows you to format plain text.

## Why use Markdown?

Markdown is useful as a universal, portable, and simple language that can be used everywhere and on anything.

## Markdown Formatting: 

### Headings

To create headings in Markdown, you use a number sign (#) in front of the heading. The tier of heading is distinguished by the number of #'s, with one # being the highest level heading and six #'s being the lowest.

> # # Heading 1
> 
> ###### ###### Heading 6

### **Bold** and *Italics*

Enboldening text requires either two asterisks or underscores before an after the word or phrase. Italicization requires simply one asterisk or underscore before and after.

> **\*\*Bold\*\*** or __\_\_Bold\_\___
> 
> *\*Italic\** or _\_Italic\__

To both Bold and Italicize at the same time, use either three asterisks or three underscores before and after the word or phrase.

> ***\*\*\*Bold and Italic\*\*\**** or ___\_\_\_Bold and Italic\_\_\____
