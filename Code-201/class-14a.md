## Psychologically Safe Teams

Mental health is a relatively new and still largely unknown field of science. Every day, there are new discoveries of how the brain is affected by internal and external stimulants. It is a frontier that progresses and regresses with every new study that is released. No matter how little we know, though, it is important to consider the psychology of others in order to best maximize our productivity, but also safety.

A few important things to consider when dealing in teams is that:

- People should be encouraged to speak. The best teams often have everyone speaking an equal amount. Criticism and debate is fine, as long as it isn't putting anyone down.
- Emotional sensitivity is important. Being able to read the room and the faces of others is necessary to know when you should back off or when you should keep going.
- Everyone should feel like they are involved. It is difficult to become motivated in your task if you don't know how your task is even useful. All teammates should be aware of the overall goal that they are working towards, and how their contributions matter.

I don't have much in the way of professional experience, but I can speak to the many years I have spent in undergrad. Every class, no matter what level they may be at, has a professor that loves group assignments. The other students, however, usually don't. There is a big stigma towards group projects that puts most people off, and that is that your group members will often be bad. I had multiple projects where I was the only one willing to let us get passing marks by actually presenting. The grade our group received would come down to how much I could learn about the other members' portions. It's difficult to really judge my old group members as incompetent, though, as I don't know how safe they felt about contributing. Perhaps if we had better group norms and emotional sensitivity, the projects would have gone much smoother.

Psychologically safe teams don't just end up being safe, they also typically outperform those that aren't. The safety and comfort allows each team member to contribute without holding back, and that ultimately increases quality and productivity.
