### A Poem

Jeffrey's on the DNS  
It tells us where he lives  
We send an HTTP request  
A site copy does it give  
Through the internet it goes  
with TCP/IP  
A 200 OK means we're close  
The webpage we now see

### Parsing Webpages

Once servers are shown legal warrants for their internals, they reluctantly give up their component files.  
The first to be given are the HTML files. These files will often have elements that tip off our lawyers and paralegals to other external linked files.  
The server will be given another notice to send over the newly discovered CSS files, usually hidden underneath "\<link>" elements. Further investigation will also yield JavaScript files behind "\<script>" elements.  
Once the external files are "willingly" handed over, our side assembles the full picture.  
The HTML files are used to create the underlying DOM tree. From there, we use the captured CSS files to generate a CSSOM structure whilst compiling and then executing any of the remaining JavaScript files.  
With all three together, we can start pressing the hard hitting charges.

### Making your dream website

A website is not truly a website until it is given a few unimaginative images to spruce up the overall look.  
To find such images, one must simply go to places such as the Google Images department store and browse their immense collection.  
A word of warning to keep an eye out for their copyright price tags. Some images can be quite pricy.

### Javascript Variable Types

JavaScript variables follow a few rules when deciding what shapes they are.  
Just remember that the "String" shape goes in the "" or '' holes, whereas the "Number" shape does not go in the "" or '' holes, but does at least need to go through the numeral hole.

### But Why Variable Models?

What you've stumbled upon goes way deeper than you could ever fathom. The Variable industry has been behind every major political assassination over the last 200 years. And behind every hit, a value storing container.  

Think about it, variables are genetically constructed to take on almost any name with the "let" keyword. They are in peak value carrying condition. They can gain entry to the most secure websites in the world. Most important of all, variables don't think for themselves. They do as they're told. They can change at a moment's notice to deliver the lethal blow to a website.

## Intro to HTML

### Attributes

Attributes contain extra hidden information about elements that won't catch the public eye.  
With names and values of their own, they work behind the element scenes to do what is necessary.

### Anatomy 101

"Welcome to Anatomy 101. I am your professor, Dr. Ymotana. Now, what is Anatomy? Anatomy is the scientific study of element structure ("morphology") and development. Morphology comes from the Greek morphos meaning shape or structure. The element body is composed of three fundamental parts: the opening tag, or the name wrapped in angle brackets, the content, and the closing tag, kind of the same as the opening tag, but with a forward slash a before the element name."

### Elemental Types

Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the many nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the div nation attacked. Only the Semantic, master of all elements, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they vanished. A couple of hours passed and \<article> and I, \<section>, discovered the limits of this joke. Article is for strong independent content that works on it's own. Section is for grouping up a part of the page that all work together functionally or thematically.

### Top X List of Used Elements. You won't believe number 4!

1. div
2. div
3. div
4. \<html>
5. Everything else: header, main, p, h, body, a, img, ul ol li, ei ei o

### Meta<sup><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></sup>

Metadata let's you match keywords so that when people look things up on Google, they will see the first 50 paid search results appearing at the top anyways.

### Meta<sup><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></sup> 2

Step 1: <meta  
Step 2: Specify (i.e charset, name/content, property) and apply (i.e = UTF-8)  
Step 3: ???  
Step 4: Profit

### Babies First Website

Parenting is a tough 24/7 job that is unrelentingly tiresome. It does, however, have its rewards. The moment when your website takes its first step; When the web designer figures out what it is they want to accomplish with their website. It's like no other. It's the moment you ask yourself, "What do I want to accomplish, how will a website help with that, and what needs to be done in what order to do so?"  
They grow up so fast.

### Semantics

"Gentlemen, I believe we have hit a snag in this debate. In order to move on, I think we need to tidy up what has amounted to an argument about semantics. What pedantry. Clifford, you want to use the \<h1> element to more properly point out a top level heading, but all Mr. Tran here wants to do is use \<span> because he likes the way it rhymes with his name!"  
"Now, while I understand your point, Mr. Tran, I believe in the greater readability and organization that semantic tags provide over the ever expanding list of \<div> elements."  
"I respectfully div-agree."

### Java x Script

Research has shown that if you put a button in front of a number of users that randomly gives them either nothing or a reward, they will endlessly click the button in order to get that reward. Now charge $1 to click the button, make a failure picture pop up whenever they fail so that they get motivated to win, and make the reward sound a nice little jingle so they feel special when they win and you have yourself a money making machine!  
All you have to do is either internal JS or link the JavaScript file to your HTML file using \<script> within the \<head> tag and you have yourself a business model.
