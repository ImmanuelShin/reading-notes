## Troubleshooting JS

Errors are an inevitability when it comes to coding. These will happen regardless if your code is even working.  
In general, code errors fall into two categories:

- Syntax errors: Spelling errors that prevent the code from working. These are typically easy to fix.
- Logic errors: The code runs but it gives incorrect or unintended results. These are usually harder to fix due to them not having a simple error message that points the error out.

Of the many errors I have faced in these past lectures, there are a few that happen more often that the others:

- Forgetting a closing curly brace.
- Forgetting semi-colons.
- Making my for loops one too long or too short.
- Calling parts of HTML that haven't loaded in yet.

These are just a few of them, but it shows that most errors I encounter are rather easy to fix. Many can be fixed through simple actions of adding a character or replacing one variable. That means that I shouldn't get discouraged from how many red console messages I encounter.

## JS Debugger

The debugger tool allows you to watch your code in finer detail as it runs. Liken it to a video editor: You can scrub back and forth between the video file, pause at specific points, and watch frame by frame. This is sort of how the debugger works. It focuses on variables and allows you to set breakpoints for them.

- Breakpoints should be set to where you want to pause code execution for debugging.

While the code is running or stopped at a breakpoint, the Call Stack allows you to see what code has been executed to get to the current point.
