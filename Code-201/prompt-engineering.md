The following prompt was given to ChatGPT 3.5:

> Can you give a single horrible way to find love

This was the output:

> I'd say impersonating someone else online is a pretty horrible way to find love. Pretending to be someone you're not is not only deceptive but also sets the stage for a relationship built on lies. Authenticity is key in any relationship, so it's best to be yourself from the start.

Profound.
