## Diversity & Inclusion

### Women in Coding

Women are currently under represented in a number of fields with computer science being one of them. This used to not be the case. Many computer pioneers were women and the number of women studying computer science grew faster than the number of men at some point.

The reason is uncertain, but at around 1984, women stopped taking up computer science and the number eventually fell. At the same time, personal computers started popping up in many U.S homes. These computers were advertised to men and boys with the games you could play and jobs it could do.  
This might not be the entire reason, but the narrative shifted the idea of what types of people typically used computers. This created a certain 'geek' culture that didn't necessarily exclude females, but at the very least didn't represent them.

Representation and role models is extremely important when it comes to inspiring children to take up certain fields. Children notice when certain jobs don't have anyone that looks like them and take cues from that regardless of whether that's beneficial or not. Thus, it's important to have diverse role models if a diverse work group is desired in the future.

### Diversity Matters

Diversity is a complicated topic when considering how to rank its priority amongst other issues in the world. The fact of the matter, though, is that diverse teams tend to work better. They especially work best when they are driven by a commitment from company leaders. This meaningful commitment means that leaders need to understand why diversity matters.

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
  - Diverse groups bring a greater amount of unique points of views.
  - With more world views comes greater creativity and a greater amount of unique solutions to problems.
- Diverse companies have a larger talent pool.
  - With more groups to choose from and talent that can come from anywhere, diversity allows a company to find a greater amount of valuable minds.
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
  - Having diverse representation within teams grants a company crucial insight into how certain communities interact or view certain products.
