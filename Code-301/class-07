## Node.js

### Intro to Node.js

An "an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."

It is built on Chrome's V8 Engine, which is the open-source JavaScript engine that Chromium-based browsers use. Node itself is built on the engine and runs while the program executes.

Installing node itself is rather simple, but there are many packages that you might want to install for your program. You can install such packages with Node's package manager, npm. To check what version of Node or npm you have on your system, simply type node -v, or npm -v (Mine is v20.8.1 and 10.1.0).  
If we wanted to install, say, a package called 'jshint', you'd type:
> npm install -g jshint

So, to sum it up, Node is a JavaScript runtime that let's you install all sorts of build tools that run alongside the program's execution. A lot of these packages can make life easier and/or add a lot of functionality.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a method of coding that involves usually two people. One person spends the entire time simply coding while the other spends the entire time navigating. The coder, or the driver, is the one typing, managing files,e tc., whereas the navigator  is the one guiding, looking for errors/bugs, and keeping an eye of what to do next. This allows for each person to focus on a smaller number of tasks and hopefully increase efficiency, speed, collaboration, learning, social skills, and exposure to interview/work environments.  
Personally, I found pair programming to be most beneficial to improving my social skills.
