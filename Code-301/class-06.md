## REST

### Psychological Safety

I've never really worked in so intimate a team that psychological safety would ever become an issue. At most, I worked with people I hardly ever talked to or even looked at.  
That being said, [the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) is still rather clear on how team dynamics can impact teams. It's important to have a high level of emotional intelligence, the ability to communicate openly, and the ability to intently listen. All of these factors aid the smooth integration of multiple members into a solid team.

### What is REST

Roy Fielding is some smart guy who had a hand in writing the first web servers. Servers that sent document across the internet. He also did a lot of research that explained why the web works the way it does.

He helped write the HTTP protocol. The protocol is necessary to let your browser find the address of other websites. HTTP points to any resource in the internet.

When a browser wants to receive resources from a location, it performs an HTTP GET. GET is actually what browsers mainly do. They always request for items that the user requests.

When a system wants to instead add something to another system, it will perform an HTTP POST.

Replacing something in another system uses HTTP PUT.  
A partial replacement/update would instead be done with HTTP PATCH.
