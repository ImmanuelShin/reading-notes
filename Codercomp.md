## Text Editors

Every computer has some sort of barebones text editor. However, third-party editors offer features that just can't be found and are sorely missed on the default editors. These features are mainly:

1. Code Completion:

   - Suggestions that pop up while you are typing in order to complete your lines faster.

2. Syntax Highlighting:

   - Coloring keywords individually so as to more easily differentiate them.

3. Theme Variety:

   - Different color palates to make the editor less straining on the eyes, or just more visually appealing.

4. Extension Support:

   - Additional features that can be downloaded to improve the user experience or capabilities.

## The Command Line

A command line, or terminal, is an interface that allows the user to enter commands in order to work with the system.

Some commands include:

1. pwd:

   - Print Working Directory - Tells you your current working directory.

2. ls:

   - List - Lists out everything in the directory within the arguments given.
   - `ls [options] [location]`

3. cd:

   - Change Directory - Allows you to move to another directory.
   - `cd [location]`

4. mkdir:

   - Make Directory - Creates a new directory.
   - `mkdir [options] <Directory>`

5. touch:

   - Create File - Creates a new file.
   - `touch [options] <filename>`

### Command Arguments

Many commands will have additional arguments that you can set in order to further specify what you want done with the command.

Examples:

1. `cd projects`:

   * This will change the directory to a folder called projects.
 
2. `mkdir new-project`:

   * This will make a new directory called new-project.

3. `touch new-project/newfile.md`:

   * This will make a new file called newfile.md in the new-project folder.

4. `cd ..`:

   * Changes the current directory by going back one along the path.

5. `ls projects/new-project`:

   * Lists out everything in the new-project folder that is in the path projects.
